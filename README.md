initial readme

Plan as is:
HOME PAGE   : landing page to start new stories, join existing stories, or read finished ones
START PAGE  : setup for new story. Give it a name, a type (word/sentence), a length (#rounds), and select a theme prompt
WRITING PAGE: Displays users working on this story, the 'prompt' (last input), and a place to write the next word/line.
STORY PAGE  : Displays information about a story: Title, Authors, Date, Story

Have a database to store stories.

Land in the HOME page. From here has new story button (to START), stories in progress (WRITING), and finished stories to read (STORY).

MVP:
home, START story, single user write, STORY page

improvements:
- user 'signin' (by session(?), just a name for self, holds between pages)
- delete stories from STORY page
- trade writing between users
- detect valid word/sentence (can be basic)
